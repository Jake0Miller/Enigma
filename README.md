# Functionality - 4

Everything works and is pretty well tested. Special characters and such work. Crack works. CLI works. So they don't always match

# OOP - 4

Project includes 2 modules. All methods shorter than 8 lines, code is broken down into helper methods and readable. All 4 classes are short. All lines below 80 chars. Implemented class methods. Everything is named clearly.

# TDD - 4

All tests are clear and thorough. Used stubs to override random dates and numbers. SimpleCov shows 100% coverage.

# VC - 3

Earlier commits and pull requests were for multiple pieces of functionality. Cleaned that up as I progressed through the project.
